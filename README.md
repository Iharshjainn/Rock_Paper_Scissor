Here's a sample **README** file for your C++ "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game code:

# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (C++)

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game in C++ for two players.

## 🎮 Game Rules

Rock (1) beats Scissors (2)
Scissors (2) beats Paper (3)
Paper (3) beats Rock (1)
If both players choose the same option, the game is a draw.

## 🧾 How to Play

1. Run the program in a C++ compiler or IDE.
2. Follow the prompts for Player 1 and Player 2 to enter their choices:

   Enter `1` for Rock
   Enter `2` for Scissors
   Enter `3` for Paper
3. The program will display the result:

   "Game Draw" if both players choose the same.
   "Player 1 wins" or "Player 2 wins" depending on the winning condition.

## 🛠️ How It Works

* The program uses simple `if-else` conditions to compare the choices.
* Winning conditions are checked based on the standard game rules.
* It handles three outcomes:

  * Draw
  * Player 1 wins
  * Player 2 wins

## 💡 Example Output


Enter 1 for Rock
Enter 2 for Scissor
Enter 3 for Paper
Player 1 turn : 
1
Player 2 turn : 
2
Player 1 wins


## 📌 Notes

The program does not validate input. If you enter a number other than 1, 2, or 3, the result will still be processed but may be incorrect.
This is a basic version for educational purposes.
